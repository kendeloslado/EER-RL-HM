# EER-RL-HM
This will be the repository for a hardware model of the EER-RL Node Clustering Algorithm, created by Mutombo et. al., which currently exists only on MATLAB. At the end of this project, which is projected to finish around mid-June, a series of verilog files pertaining to the hardware blocks of EER-RL will be in this repository.

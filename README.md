# EER-RL-HM
This will be the repository for a hardware model of the EER-RL Node Clustering Algorithm, created by Mutombo et. al., which currently exists only on MATLAB. At the end of this project, a series of Verilog files pertaining to the hardware blocks of EER-RL will be in this repository. A series of hardware blocks, alongside functional testbenches will be attached here at the end of the project.


Here is the link containing the author's original MATLAB code, alongside the PDF of their paper.
